============

The easiest way to get scHPL is through pip using the following command::

    sudo pip install -U schpl

You can also get the latest development version from `Github <https://github.com/lcmmichielsen/scHPL>`_ using the following steps:
First, clone scHPL using ``git``::

    git clone https://github.com/lcmmichielsen/scHPL


Then, ``cd`` to the scHPL folder and run the install command::

On Windows machines you may need to download a C++ compiler if you wish to build from source yourself.
